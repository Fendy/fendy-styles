> _Where do I put my styles? How do I name this class? Should I be using SMACSS? OOCSS? BEM? Atomic? SASS? LESS? POSTCSS? OHMYCSS?_

I feel you, I do. **Fendy Styles** provides a solid architecture for your project's styles, it's based on [ITCSS](https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/) so it **scales** and is **maintainable**. It also comes with some handy foundations (SASS foundations) on which to build upon. It's also content and design **agnostic** so it shouldn't get in your way. It'll make you happier, healthier and fitter so what are you waiting for? 🤓
